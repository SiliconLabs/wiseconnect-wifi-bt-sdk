# MQTT Client

## 1. Purpose / Scope 

This application demonstrates how to configure RS9116W EVK as MQTT client and how to establish connection with MQTT broker and how to subscribe, publish and receive the MQTT messages from MQTT broker. In this application, RS9116W EVK is configured as WiFi station and connects to Access Point. After successful WiFi connection, application connects to MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic ***"MQTT_DEMO"*** and publishes a message ***"THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION"*** on that subscribed topic. The application waits to receive the data published on subscribed topic by other clients.

#### 5.3 Common Steps 

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN / WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK mode to connect RS9116W EVK in STA mode.

2. To run MQTT broker in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command: 

```sh
mosquitto.exe –p 1883 –v
```

![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/image_3.png)

3. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on "Advanced" as shown in the below image.

![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/image_4.png)

4. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired "TOPIC_NAME" in topic field and click on "ADD". Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on "BACK" as shown in below image.

![Add "TOPIC_NAME" in topic field](resources/readme/image_5.png)

5. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on "CONNECT" to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image. 

![MQTT broker Configuration](resources/readme/image_6.png)

6. After the program gets executed, the RS9116W EVK will be connected to the same access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get IP.

7. Once the RS9116W EVK gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

![User can see the client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/image_7.png)

8. After successful subscription to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**, the RS9116W EVK publishes a message which is given in **publish_message** array
  (Ex: "THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION") on the subscribed topic.

9. MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the RS9116W EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the RS9116W EVK](resources/readme/image_8.png)

10. In the MQTT broker, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed topic to that topic. 

![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/image_9.png)

11. Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under "Publish" tab, select "raw" data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on "publish". This message will be received by the RS9116W EVK.

### 5.4 Procedure For exexcuting the Application when enabled with SSL

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect Silicon Labs device in STA mode.

2. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC2 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

3. User needs to update the mosquitto.conf file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

4. Also, add "certs" folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

5. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port can be 1883/8883)
   
   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
  ![For opening MQTT server ](resources/readme/image_11.png)  

6. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version "tlsv1", just comment the "tls_version tlsv1" in mosquitto.conf file

7. From here, repeat the steps from step 4 to step 9 of **5.3** to complete the execution.

> Note:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in mosquitto.conf file:
  listener 1883
  allow_anonymous true
> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  "mosquitto -v -p 1883 -c config/mosquitto.conf"
  where config is the sub folder and mosquitto.conf is the different config file than default.
> Limitations: 
> MQTT client application keeps on polling for the data to receive on the subscribed topic irrespective of receive timeout mentioned in the rsi_mqtt_poll_for_recv_data API.
