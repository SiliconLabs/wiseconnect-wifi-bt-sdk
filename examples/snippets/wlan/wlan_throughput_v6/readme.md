# WLAN Throughput

## Introduction
This application demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP/SSL throughput by configuring the RS9116W in client/server role.
In this application, the RS9116W connects to a Wi-Fi access point, obtains an IP address, connects to Iperf server/client running on a remote PC and measures Tx/Rx throughput transmitted/received from remote PC.

## Setting Up 
To use this application, the following hardware, software and project setup is required.

* This application is also configured to use the SDIO bus for interfacing between Host platforms (EFM32GG11) and the RS9116W EVK.

### Bare Metal/RTOS Support
To select a bare metal configuration, see [Selecting bare metal](#selecting-bare-metal).

### Wi-Fi Configuration
Configure the following parameters in [rsi_throughput_app.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/examples/featured/wlan_throughput/rsi_throughput_app.c) to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

```c
#define SSID           "SILABS_AP"      // Wi-Fi Network Name
#define PSK            "1234567890"     // Wi-Fi Password
#define SECURITY_TYPE  RSI_WPA2         // Wi-Fi Security Type: RSI_OPEN / RSI_WPA / RSI_WPA2
#define CHANNEL_NO     0                // Wi-Fi channel if the softAP is used (0 = auto select)
```

### Client/Server IP Settings
```c
#define PORT_NUM           <local_port>   // Local port to use
#define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>  // Remote server port
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "2001:db8:0:1::121"  // Remote server IP address 
                                          
```

## Throughput Measurement Types
The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP or SSL/TLS packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.
```c
#define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option; see the following diagrams. 
#define TCP_TX           0			// RS9116W transmits packets to remote TCP client
#define TCP_RX           1			// RS9116W receives packets from remote TCP server
#define UDP_TX           2			// RS9116W transmits packets to remote UDP client
#define UDP_RX           3			// RS9116W receives packets from remote UDP server
#define SSL_TX           4			// RS9116W transmits packets to remote SSL client
#define SSL_RX           5			// RS9116W receives packets from remote SSL server
```

## Throughput Options
Various options are available to customize throughput measurements. Some options only apply for specific throughput types as secribed in the following sections.

### Discrete Interval Measurements (UDP Rx and SSL Tx)
```c
#define MAX_TX_PKTS 10000
```
The default value of `MAX_TX_PKTS` is 10000. To measure throughput for higher intervals, make the following changes:
- UDP Rx : Increase the value of `MAX_TX_PKTS` and provide a higher interval in the corresponding iperf command
- SSL Tx : Increase the value of `MAX_TX_PKTS` and update the equivalent value in `SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py` located in the  release directory `resources/scripts/`.

### Discrete Interval Measurements (UDP Tx and TCP Tx)
```c
#define THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME  30000   // Throughput average time in ms
```
Configure `THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME` to suit the desired interval.

### Discrete Interval Measurements (TCP Rx and SSL Rx)
- TCP Rx : Configure the interval desired using the corresponding iperf command
- SSL Rx : Increase the packet count in `SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py` located in the release directory `/resources/scripts/`.

### Continous Throughput Measurements
```c
#define CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT        0
```

**`CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT` = `0`** (default value)
- Throughput is calculated only once for interval of :
  - `THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME` in case of UDP TX/TCP TX 
  - `MAX_TX_PKTS` in case of UDP RX/SSL TX  
- The time interval is provided by the server in case of TCP RX
- Default packet count is provided in server `SSL_tx_throughput.py` in case of `SSL RX`

**`CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT` = `1`**. 
- The application measures throughput continuously for every interval of `THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME` regardless of `THROUGHPUT_TYPE`, when provided with the following configuration. 
  - UDP Rx/TCP Rx : Configure high interval greater than `THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME`
  - SSL Rx/SSL Tx : Increase packet count to the maximum in the scripts `SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py` and `SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py`

***

**Note!**
If `CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT` = `1`, ensure that the RS9116W client/server runs with an interval greater than `THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME`.

***


# Testing Throughput
There are two 'ends' involved when measuring throughput, data is sent between the client end and the server end. By default, the Iperf protocol sends data from the Client to the Server to measure throughput. Depending on the configuration selected, the RS9116W may be the client or the server. In general, it is advisable to start the server before the client since the client will immediately begin to try to connect to the server to send data. 

The following sections describe how to run the RS9116W throughput application together with examples for various Iperf configurations that run on the PC.   


## Running the RS9116 Application
After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as described in the [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/) or [STM32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/). 


## UDP Tx Throughput
To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the RS9116W as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP server on the PC is: 

> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -V -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
> 
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -V -p 5001 -i 1`


## UDP Rx Throughput
To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the RS9116W as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP client is: 
	
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -V -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c  2001:db8:0:1::121 -u -V -p 5001 -i 1 -b 50M -t 30`  

## TCP Tx Throuhgput
To measure TCP Tx throughput, configure the RS9116W as a TCP client and start a TCP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP server is: 
		
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -V -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -V -p 5001 -i 1`

## TCP Rx Throughput
To measure TCP Rx throughput, configure the RS9116W as TCP server and start a TCP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP client is: 

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -V -p <module_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 2001:db8:0:1::121 -V -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30`  

## SSL Tx Throughput
To measure SSL Tx throughput, configure the RS9116W as a SSL client and start a SSL server on the remote PC as described in the following bullets:
- Copy the `SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` directory to the `/resources/certificates/` directory
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py`

## SSL Rx Throughput
To measure SSL RX throughput, configure the RS9116W as a SSL server and open a SSL client on the remote PC as described in the following bullets:
- Copy the `SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` directory to the `/resources/certificates/`
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py`

The RS9116W, which is configured as a UDP/TCP/SSL server/client, connects to the iperf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While module is transmitting/receiving the data, application prints the throughput numbers in serial console.


***

**Note!**
In this release, due to a low SPI frequency configured for the EFR32, WLAN throughput is lower than the maximum achievable throughput. This will be addressed in the next release.
