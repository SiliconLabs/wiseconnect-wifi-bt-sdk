# Power Save Deep Sleep

## 1. Purpose / Scope 

This application demonstrates how to enable power save deep sleep profile with RS9116W EVK. This application enables power save profile mode 8 and then wait in a scheduler for some time. Once it will come out of delay, it will connect to the configured AP and open udp client socket. It sends some packets to the udp server, disconnects from AP and goes back to deep sleep.

#### 4.1.2 The desired parameter are provided below. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements

The following parameters are configured if OS is used. WLAN task should be of low priority

```c
#define RSI_WLAN_TASK_PRIORITY                   1
```
   
Driver task should have the highest priority among all threads

```c

> Note:
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through DHCP then set DHCP_MODE to "1" and skip configuring the following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.
> (Or)
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through STATIC then set DHCP_MODE macro to “0” and configure following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.

IP address to be configured to the device in STA mode should be in long format and in little endian byte order.

   Example: To configure “192.168.10.10” as IP address, update the macro DEVICE_IP as 0x0A0AA8C0.

```c
#define   DEVICE_IP                        0X0A0AA8C0

```c
#define   GATEWAY                          0x010AA8C0
```

IP address of the network mask should also be in long format and in little endian byte order.

   Example: To configure “255.255.255.0” as network mask, update the macro NETMASK as 0x00FFFFFF

```c
#define   NETMASK                          0x00FFFFFF

In this application, default power save mode configuration is set to low power mode 8 (RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8) with maximum power save (RSI_MAX_PSP) with message based hand shake.

```c
#define   PSP_MODE                         RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8
#define   PSP_TYPE                         RSI_MAX_PSP 
```

#### 4.1.3 If the user wants different power save modes, update/modify the below macros

PSP_MODE refers to the power save profile mode. RS9116W EVK supports the following power modes:

   - RSI_ACTIVE (0)   : In this mode, module is active and power save is disabled.

   - RSI_SLEEP_MODE_1 (1): In this power mode, module goes to power save after association with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will never turn off, therefore no handshake is required before sending data to the module.

   - RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 (2): In this power mode, module goes to power save after association with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO hand shake or Message exchange, therefore handshake is required before sending data to the module.

   - RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8 (8): In this power mode, module goes to power save when it is in unassociated state with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO hand shake or Message exchange, therefore handshake is required before sending the command to the module.

```c
#define   PSP_MODE                         RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8
```

WiSeConnect device supports following power save modes:

   - RSI_CONNECTED_GPIO_BASED_PS = 2

   - RSI_CONNECTED_MSG_BASED_PS = 3

   - RSI_GPIO_BASED_DEEP_SLEEP = 8

   - RSI_MSG_BASED_DEEP_SLEEP = 9

Among the above mentioned four power save modes, which power save mode must be selected will depend upon the two macros i.e., PSP_MODE and RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE selection.

   | RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE     | PSP_MODE                              |                               |
   | :----                     | :----                                 | :----                         |
   |                           | RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 (Connected_SLEEP)    | RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8 (Deep_SLEEP) |
   | GPIO_BASED                | RSI_CONNECTED_GPIO_BASED_PS = 2       | RSI_GPIO_BASED_DEEP_SLEEP = 8 |
   | MSG_BASED                 | RSI_CONNECTED_MSG_BASED_PS = 3        | RSI_MSG_BASED_DEEP_SLEEP = 9  |

 
> Note:
> For RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 and RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8 modes, GPIO or Message based hand shake can be selected using RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE macro which is define in rsi_wlan_config.h
> In this example user can verify RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 with Message based hand shake. If user wants to verify other power modes, user has to change the application as well as GPIO hand shake signals.

PSP_TYPE refers power save profile type. WiSeConnect device supports following power save profile types :

   - RSI_MAX_PSP (0)  : In this mode, WiSeConnect device will be in Maximum power save mode. i.e Device will wake up for every DTIM beacon and do data Tx and Rx. 
  
   - RSI_FAST_PSP (1): In this mode, WiSeConnect device will disable power save for any Tx/Rx packet for monitor interval of time (monitor interval can be set through macro in release/examples/snippets/wlan/power_save_deep_sleep/rsi_wlan_config.h file, default value is 50 ms).If there is no data for monitor interval of time then module will again enable power save.
  
   - RSI_UAPSD (2)  : This PSP_TYPE is used to enable WMM power save.

```c
#define   PSP_TYPE                         RSI_MAX_PSP
```

> Note: 
> PSP_TYPE is valid only when PSP_MODE set to RSI_SLEEP_MODE_1 or RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 mode.
> RSI_UAPSD power profile type in PSP_TYPE is valid only when RSI_WMM_PS_ENABLE is enabled in rsi_wlan_config.h file.


### 4.2 Open rsi_wlan_config.h file

#### 4.2.1 The desired parameters are provided below. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements 


```c
#define   CONCURRENT_MODE                  RSI_DISABLE
#define   RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP              (FEAT_SECURITY_OPEN | FEAT_ULP_GPIO_BASED_HANDSHAKE)
#define   RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS                RSI_DISABLE
#define   RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP       TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT

#define   RSI_DTIM_ALIGNED_TYPE            0
#define   RSI_MONITOR_INTERVAL             50
#define   RSI_WMM_PS_ENABLE                RSI_DISABLE
#define   RSI_WMM_PS_TYPE                  0    
#define   RSI_WMM_PS_WAKE_INTERVAL         20
#define   RSI_WMM_PS_UAPSD_BITMAP          15
```

#### 4.2.2 The application is provided with RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8 configurtion. If the user wants to modify different power save modes, update/modify the below macros

RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE is used to select GPIO or Message based hand shake in RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 and RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8 modes.

```c
#define   RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE              GPIO_BASED 
```

RSI_SELECT_LP_OR_ULP_MODE is used to select low power mode or ultra low power mode. 

   Valid configurations are:

   - RSI_LP_MODE        : In this module will be in Low power mode.

   - RSI_ULP_WITH_RAM_RET : In this module will be in Ultra low power mode and it will remember the previous state after issuing power save mode command.

   - RSI_ULP_WITHOUT_RAM_RET : In this module will be in Ultra low power mode and it will not remember the previous state after issuing power save mode command. In order to wake the module up, the user needs to call wake up API (rsi_req_wakeup). Once the module wakes up, it gives CARD READY indication to the host and the user has to issue commands from wireless Initialization API (rsi_wireless_init).  

```c
#define   RSI_SELECT_LP_OR_ULP_MODE        RSI_LP_MODE 
```

RSI_DTIM_ALIGNED_TYPE refers whether module has to wake up at normal beacon or DTIM beacon which is just before listen interval. 

   If RSI_DTIM_ALIGNED_TYPE is set to 0 i.e module will wake up at normal beacon which is just before listen interval

   If RSI_DTIM_ALIGNED_TYPE is set to 1 i.e module will wake up at DTIM beacon which is just before listen interval

```c
#define    RSI_DTIM_ALIGNED_TYPE           0 
```
RSI_MONITOR_INTERVAL refers amount of time (in ms) to wait for Tx or Rx before giving power save indication to connected Access Point.

```c
#define     RSI_MONITOR_INTERVAL           50
```
> Note:
> RSI_MONITOR_INTERVAL is applicable only when PSP_TYPE selected as RSI_FAST_PSP

RSI_WMM_PS_ENABLE is used to enable or disable WMM power save.

```c
#define     RSI_WMM_PS_ENABLE              0 
 ```
  
RSI_WMM_PS_TYPE is used to set Tx based or Periodic based WMM power save.Update RSI_WMM_PS_TYPE macro with 0 for Tx Based or 1 for periodic based WMM power save.

```c
#define     RSI_WMM_PS_TYPE                0 
```
RSI_WMM_PS_WAKE_INTERVAL refers at periodic time (in ms) module has to wake up module when RSI_WMM_PS_TYPE selected as Periodic.

```c
#define     RSI_WMM_PS_WAKE_INTERVAL       20
```

RSI_WMM_PS_UAPSD_BITMAP refers UAPSD bitmap

```c
#define     RSI_WMM_PS_UAPSD_BITMAP        15 
```     
> Note:
> If RSI_WMM_PS_ENABLE is enabled then user has to set PSP_TYPE to RSI_UAPSD in order to work with WMM power save mode.
