# Socket Select 

## 1. Purpose / Scope 

This application demonstrates how to create the multiple sockets in RS9116W EVK and monitor multiple sockets for a certain activity to occur. If there is some data to be read on one of the sockets, the Select provides the response about the socket whether the data is to be read on the socket or not.

## 4. Application Configuration Parameters 

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed. 

### 4.1 Open rsi_socket_select.c file 

#### 4.1.1 User must update the below parameters 

SSID refers to the name of the Access point.

```c
#define SSID                                    "SILABS_AP"
```
    
CHANNEL_NO refers to the channel in which device should scan. If it is 0 device will scan all channels.

```c
#define CHANNEL_NO                              0
```
  
SECURITY_TYPE refers to the type of security. In this application STA supports Open, WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK securities.

   Valid configuration is:
   
   - RSI_OPEN - For OPEN security mode
   - RSI_WPA - For WPA security mode
   - RSI_WPA2 - For WPA2 security mode
   
```c
#define SECURITY_TYPE                           RSI_WPA2
```

PSK refers to the secret key if the Access point configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

```c
#define PSK                  "1234567890"
```
  
#### 4.1.2 The desired parameters are provided below. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements.

To configure IP address
  
DHCP_MODE refers whether IP address configured through DHCP or STATIC

```c
#define DHCP_MODE                               1
```

> Note:
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through DHCP then set DHCP_MODE to "1" and skip configuring the following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.
> (Or)
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through STATIC then set DHCP_MODE macro to "0" and configure following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.

IP address to be configured to the device in STA mode should be in long format and in little endian byte order.
   
Example: To configure "192.168.10.10" as IP address, update the macro DEVICE_IP as 0x0A0AA8C0.

```c
#define DEVICE_IP                               0X0A0AA8C0
```

IP address of the gateway should also be in long format and in little endian byte order

   Example: To configure "192.168.10.1" as Gateway, update the macro GATEWAY as 0x010AA8C0.

```c
#define GATEWAY                                 0x010AA8C0
 ```
   
IP address of the network mask should also be in long format and in little endian byte order

   Example: To configure "255.255.255.0" as network mask, update the macro NETMASK as 0x00FFFFFF.

```c
#define NETMASK                                 0x00FFFFFF
```

Application memory length which is required by the driver
   
```c
#define GLOBAL_BUFF_LEN                         15000
```

User can connect to access point through PMK

   To Enable keep 1 else 0

```c
#define CONNECT_WITH_PMK                         0
```

> Note:
> If CONNECT_WITH_PMK is enabled, SECURITY_TYPE is set to RSI_WPA2_PMK.


### 4.2 Open rsi_wlan_config.h file. User can also modify the below parameters as per their needs and requirements. 


```c
#define CONCURRENT_MODE                      RSI_DISABLE
#define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                  FEAT_SECURITY_OPEN

#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP           (TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT | TCP_IP_FEAT_EXTENSION_VALID)
#define RSI_EXT_TCPIP_FEATURE_BITMAP         (RSI_NUMBER_OF_SELECTS << 12)
#define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP           0
#define RSI_BAND                             RSI_BAND_2P4GHZ
```

**Power save configuration**

   - By default, the application is configured without power save.
  
```c
#define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE          0
```

   - If user wants to run the application in power save, modify the below macro.

```c
#define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE          1
```

## 5. Testing the Application 

Follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware 

Refer [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`


### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform 

#### 5.2.1 Using STM32 

Refer [Getting started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/)

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/socket_select_app/projects/socket_select_app-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project.
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32 

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms 

- Open Simplicity Studio and import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/socket_select_app/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps 

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN / WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK mode to connect RS9116W EVK in STA mode.

2. After the program gets executed, RS9116W EVK is configured as client and connects to AP and gets IP.

3. After successful connection with the access point, the socket select is issued for the desired socket.

4. Open UDP client from WindowsPC2 and connect to UDP server opened on the device on port number DEVICE_PORT. The Iperf command to start the UDP client is: 

> `C:\> iperf.exe -u -c <Module_IP> -p <DEVICE_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -u -c 192.168.0.100 -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30` 

5. Select provides the response about the socket whether the data is to be read on the socket or not.

6. If data is to be received on the socket, then the receive function is called on the socket.
