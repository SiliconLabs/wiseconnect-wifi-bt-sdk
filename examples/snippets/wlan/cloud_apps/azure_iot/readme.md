#define CONNECTION_STRING \
"HostName=xxxxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=xxxxx_Device_SelfSign;x509=true" ///< Connection string
#define MESSAGE_COUNT \
5 ///< Number of D2C messages sent to Azure Hub and also minimum number of C2D messages to be received by application
#define CLIENT_PORT 4002 ///< Client port
```

### 4.4 To Load Certificate

   **rsi\_wlan\_set\_certificate()** API expects the certificate in the form of linear array. Convert the pem certificate into linear array form using python script provided in the SDK `<SDK>/resources/certificates/certificate_script.py`.
   
   ```sh
   For example : If the certificate is ca-certificate.pem, enter the command in the following way:
   python certificate_script.py ca-certificate.pem 
   The script will generate ca-certificate.pem in which one linear array named ca-certificate contains the certificate.
   ```
Root CA certificate, Device private key and Device client certificate needs to be converted as mentioned above

After the conversion, place the converted files in `<SDK>/resources/certificates/` path and include the certificate files in rsi_azure_telemetry_c2d.c

   Replace the default Device certificate and Private key certificate in the application with the converted pem file name.

   ```c
   // Certificate includes
   #include "azure_client_certificate.pem.crt.h"
   #include "azure_client_private_key.pem.key.h"
   #include "azure_starfield_ca.pem.h"
   ```

   Replace the default Device certificate and Private key certificate given in `rsi_wlan_set_certificate()` API in the application with the converted pem array.

   ```c
   // Load Security Certificates
   status = rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CLIENT, azure_client_certificate, (sizeof(azure_client_certificate) - 1));
  
   status =
   rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY, azure_client_private_key, (sizeof(azure_client_private_key) - 1));
   ```

> NOTE :
> For Azure connectivity, Baltimore Root CA certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
> 
> The Baltimore Root CA certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and it plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
> 
> On RS9116 device, we do not maintain root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load Baltimore Root CA certificate for successful mutual authentication to Azure server.
> 
> On RS9116 to authenticate the Azure server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA validation is successful , other certificates sent from the Azure server are validated.
> RS9116 don't authenticate to Azure server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of Baltimore Root CA certificate and would result in Handshake error.
> Baltimore Root CA certificate is at https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. Configure the Access point with Internet connection in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect RS9116W EVK STA mode.
2. Load the required certificates 
3. Login into Azure account. Create IoT Hub in Azure portal. Add IoT Device in the Hub created.
4. Update the connection string in `azure_iot_config.h` with 
   - Primary key of the IoT Device for Symmetric key authentication

> For example : "HostName=example.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=example_Device_SymKey;SharedAccessKey=TAEw6g7gEJh6zB74ykuiUnA8UbUhsSApuqFIgd/YB6Y="

   - Connection string for IoT Device with X.509 self signed authentication

> For example : "HostName=example.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=example_Device_SelfSign;x509=true"

> **Note:** Connection string can be generated as specified in Appendix section **Register a New X.509 Authenticated Device with IoT Hub** for X509 and for Symmetric Key follow  **Register IoT Device with symmetric key authentication in IoT Hub** section.

5. By default, application tries to connect to Azure Hub using X.509 self signed authentication mechanism.
6. Connect any serial console for prints.
7. Compile and run the application.
8 The example application on execution will send 5 telemetry messages to Azure Hub and waits to receive atleast 5 C2D messages.
9. Following logs will be displayed on the console
![Console logs](resources/readme/image377.png)
10. Refer to Appendix section **Steps to check Telemetry message on Azure cloud** to check the application sent messages on cloud.
11. Refer to Appendix section **Steps to send c2d message from the cloud** to how to send C2D messages from Azure Hub


**Note the following :**

   ```c
   NOTE-1 :  
   If the requirement is to continue the application flow after SDK De-Init i.e Reconnect to the Azure Hub to send and receive messages, following Steps need to be followed :
    - Change the state variable to RSI_WLAN_IOTHUB_LL_INIT_STATE in state RSI_WLAN_IOTHUB_LL_DEINIT_STATE.
   
    - Add delay of 10sec for application to properly terminate the socket connections
      
    - Refer the snippet shared below :
   
   **case RSI_WLAN_IOTHUB_LL_DEINIT_STATE**: {
   IoTHubDeviceClient_LL_Destroy(device_ll_handle);
   IoTHub_Deinit();
   // Reset all the global variables
   messages_sent = 0;
   g_message_count_send_confirmations = 0;
   g_message_recv_count = 0;
   g_continueRunning = true;
   LOG_PRINT("IoTHub DeInit Done. Re-INIT Application\r\n");
   rsi_wlan_app_cb.state = RSI_WLAN_IOTHUB_LL_INIT_STATE ;

   rsi_delay(10000);
   #ifdef RSI_WITH_OS
   rsi_semaphore_post(&rsi_mqtt_sem);
   #endif
    break;

   NOTE-2 :
    - rsi_recv() timeout value is by default configured as 5 seconds (RECV_TIMEOUT_VAL value in azure_iot_config.h)
    - If there is no data from Azure Hub, application thread will be blocked for 5 seconds in rsi_recv()
    - RECV_TIMEOUT_VAL can be modified to value less than 5 seconds to reduce the wait time in rsi_recv()

   NOTE-3 :
    - There may be a delay observed in sending MQTT Keepalive packets from the application. 
    - The delay will be observed if application thread is waiting in rsi_recv() (Refer NOTE-2)  when Keepalive timeout expires.
    - The maximum delay obseved will be RECV_TIMEOUT_VAL.
    - Reducing the RECV_TIMEOUT_VAL will reduce the delay seen to send MQTT Keepalive packets.
   ```

![Select IoT Device](resources/readme/image373.png)

  **Step 3:** In **Create a device,** provide a name for your new device and select authentication type as "Symmetric key" and Save. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

![Create Device](resources/readme/image374.png)

  **Step 4:** After the device is created, open the device from the list in the **IoT devices** pane. Select Device created  and copy the **Primary Connection String** for use later.

![Primary connection string](resources/readme/image375.png)

  **Step 5:** The primary connection string is used in application to connect device to IoT Hub.

Device is now successfully registered to IoT Hub with Symmetric key authentication type.

1.3.2 - ***Register a New X.509 Authenticated Device with IoT Hub***

 For X.509 self-signed authentication, sometimes referred to as thumbprint authentication, you need to create certificates to place on your device. These certificates have a thumbprint in them that you share with IoT Hub for authentication.
 
 Follow the steps below or refer to the [Register a X.509 Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-authenticate-downstream-device?view=iotedge-2021-11#x509-self-signed-authentication)

  **Step 1:** Generating X509 Self Signed certificates

Generate the IoT device's x509 Certificate and the Private Key Certificate by using the below OpenSSL command from a Powershell window

   `Openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydevkitkey.pem -x509 -days 365 -out mydevkitcertificate.pem`

  - `mydevkitkey.pem` is the Private Key file
  - `mydevkitcertificate.pem` is the x509 device certificate file
 
 **Step 2:** Capture the x509 certificate's Fingerprint either SHA1 or SHA256 type.[your choice]
 
  command for SHA-1 : openssl x509 -in mydevkitcertificate.pem -fingerprint -noout.
 
  Command for SHA-256 : openssl x509 -in mydevkitcertificate.pem -fingerprint -noout -sha256
 
  Copy the fingerprint hexadecimal number with 40 length [have considered SHA1 type].
 
  Remove the **':'** from the fingerprint and it will look as shown below : 

  `3989467851D9C76811C3B1DF939AE0A103E838CA`

  **Step 3:** Go to Azure Portal-IoTHub to create new device with authentication type as X.509 Self-signed

![Create x509 Device](resources/readme/image376.png)

  **Step 4:** Connection string to be given in the application should be as follows

  `HostName=<Hub name>;DeviceId=<Device id(myselfsigned)>;x509=true`

   Device is now successfully registered with the IoT Hub with X.509 self signed authentication type.
