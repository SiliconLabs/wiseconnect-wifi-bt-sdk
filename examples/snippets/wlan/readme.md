## 5. Testing the Application

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application. 

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`


### 5.2 Building the Application on Host Platform

#### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [Getting started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/)

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/access_point_v6/projects/access_point_v6-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx`
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116 , then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Add the macro RSI_CONFIGURE_IPV6=1 in the preprocessor settings (Project -> Options for Target -> C/C++ -> Preprosessor Symbols)
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Open Simplicity Studio and import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/access_point_v6/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to Rs9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Add the macro RSI_CONFIGURE_IPV6=1 in the preprocessor settings to enable IPv6 (Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings ->GNU ARM C Compiler ->Preprosessor)
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. After program gets executed, RS9116W EVK will be created as an access point with configured **SSID** (Ex: "**SILABS_AP"**) and opens TCP server socket on **DEVICE_PORT** and waits for TCP connection request from TCP client. Now scan and connect to device access point (Ex: "SILABS_AP" is the AP name) from laptop.

2. After successful connection, open iperf application from remote PC command Prompt.

3. Connect to TCP Server running on RS9116W EVK using below command 

    `iperf.exe -c <DEVICE_IP> -p <DEVICE_PORT> -V -i 1 -t 100`


4. The RS9116W EVK accepts connection request and receives data on the TCP server port and exit after receiving configured NUMBER_OF_PACKETS
