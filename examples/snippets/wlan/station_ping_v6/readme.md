# Station Ping (IPv6)

## 1. Purpose / Scope

Ping is used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is actually operating. Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply. Ping can be used for troubleshooting to test connectivity and determine response time.
The application demonstrates how to configure Silicon Labs device in client mode to send ping request to target IP address .

## 5. Steps for Executing the Application

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Steps for Compiling and Building the Application on the Host Platform

### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [Getting started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/) 

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/station_ping_v6/projects/station_ping_v6-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build the project
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Add the macro RSI_CONFIGURE_IPV6=1 in the preprocessor settings (Project -> Options for Target -> C/C++ -> Preprosessor Symbols)
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Open Simplicity Studio and import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/station_ping_v6/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Add the macro RSI_CONFIGURE_IPV6=1 in the preprocessor settings to enable IPv6 (Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings ->GNU ARM C Compiler ->Preprosessor)
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


### 5.3 Common Steps

   1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect Silicon Labs device in STA mode.
   
   2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module configured as client and connects to AP and gets IP.

   3. After successful connection with the Access Point, the device starts sending ping requests to the given **REMOTE_IP** with configured **PING_SIZE** to check availability of target device.
   
   4. Device sends the number of ping packets configured in **NUMBER_OF_PACKETS**.
   
   5. In rsi_station_ping.c file, **rsi_wlan_ping_async** API returns success status, which means that the ping request packet is successfully sent in to the medium. When actual ping response comes from the remote node, it is known from the status parameter of the callback function (**rsi_ping_response_handler**) registered in the Ping API.
