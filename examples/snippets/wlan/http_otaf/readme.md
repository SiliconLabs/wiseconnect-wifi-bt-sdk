# HTTP/HTTPS OTA

## 1. Purpose / Scope 

This application demonstrates how to update new firmware to RS9116W EVK using remote HTTP/s server or cloud storage server.

In this application, RS9116W EVK connects to Access Point as HTTP/HTTPS client and establishes connection with HTTP/s server (Apache server) or the cloud storage server (i.e., AWS S3 bucket/Azure Blob storage). After successful HTTP/s connection, RS9116W EVK sends firmware file request (HTTP GET Request) to remote server and server responds with Firmware file. 

The server transferred firmware file gets loaded/updated in the RS9116 module flash memory. After successful firmware update, HTTP/s OTA API returns success response.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements 

Before running the application, set up the following.

### 4.1 Open rsi_http_otaf_app.c file

#### 4.1.1 User must update the below common parameters  

SSID refers to the name of the Access point.

```c
#define SSID                         "SILABS_AP"
```
  
CHANNEL_NO refers to the channel in which AP would be started
  
```c
#define CHANNEL_NO                  0
 ```
  
SECURITY_TYPE refers to the type of security. Generally Access point supports Open, WPA, WPA2 securities.
  
   Valid configuration is:

   - RSI_OPEN - For OPEN security mode

   - RSI_WPA  - For WPA security mode

   - RSI_WPA2 - For WPA2 security mode
  
```c
#define SECURITY_TYPE                RSI_WPA2
```

PSK refers to the secret key of the Access point(applies when AP is configured in WPA/WPA2 security modes)
  
```c
#define PSK                          "1234567890"
```

The following parameters are configured if OS is used. WLAN task should be of low priority

```c
#define RSI_WLAN_TASK_PRIORITY                   1
```
   
Driver task should have the highest priority among all threads

```c
#define RSI_DRIVER_TASK_PRIORITY                 2
```

WLAN Task stack size is configured by this macro
	 
```c
#define RSI_WLAN_TASK_STACK_SIZE           500
```

Driver Task stack size is configured by this macro

   char *hostname                             ="example.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com";
   ```
   
   **Note:** The `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` is provided as empty string "" since the S3 bucket URL created has public access provided. Refer Appendix section 6.1 on how to upload Firmware in AWS S3 Bucket. 


* **For Azure Blob storage**
   * Include Digicert (Baltimore CyberTrust Root) certificate file for SSL connection
   
> Note : The certificate authority for Azure Blob storage is Digicert, hence we need to include Digicert Root (Baltimore CyberTrust Root) certification for SSL connection to be successful. This certificate is already included in the SDK in linear array format "http_batimore_ca.pem.h" which can be directly used for SSL connection to Azure Blob storage.

   * Extract the hostname from Azure Blob storage URL `https://<Your-Blob-Name>.blob.core.windows.net/rps/firmware.rps` and provide it in hostname
   
> Example: For Azure Blob storage URL "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/example_directory/firmware.rps", hostname will be "example.blob.core.windows.net"

   * Extract the firmware package name from URL `https://<Your-Blob-Name>.blob.core.windows.net/rps/firmware.rps` and provide it in HTTP_URL

> Example: For Azure Blob storage URL "https://example.blob.core.windows.net/example_directory/firmware.rps", HTTP_URL will be "rps/firmware.rps"

   ```c
   //Sample configurations
   #include "http_baltimore_ca.pem.h"        //Baltimore Root CA
   #define FLAGS                             HTTPS_SUPPORT

   char *hostname                            ="example.blob.core.windows.net";
   ```
**Note:** The USERNAME and PASSWORD is provided as empty string "" since the Azure Blob storage URL created has public access provided. Refer to Appendix section 6.2 on how to upload Firmware in Azure Blob storage

### 4.2 Open  rsi_wlan_config.h file. User can also modify the below parameters as per their needs and requirements.

* For Apache HTTP Server

```c
#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP (TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT | TCP_IP_FEAT_HTTP_CLIENT | TCP_IP_FEAT_EXTENSION_VALID)
#define RSI_EXT_TCPIP_FEATURE_BITMAP EXT_FEAT_HTTP_OTAF_SUPPORT
```
   
* For Apache HTTPS Server

```c
#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP (TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT | TCP_IP_FEAT_HTTP_CLIENT| TCP_IP_FEAT_EXTENSION_VALID | TCP_IP_FEAT_SSL)
#define RSI_EXT_TCPIP_FEATURE_BITMAP EXT_FEAT_HTTP_OTAF_SUPPORT
```

* For AWS S3 Bucket/Azure Blob storage       

```c
#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP (TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT | TCP_IP_FEAT_HTTP_CLIENT| TCP_IP_FEAT_EXTENSION_VALID | TCP_IP_FEAT_SSL | TCP_IP_FEAT_DNS_CLIENT)
#define RSI_EXT_TCPIP_FEATURE_BITMAP (EXT_FEAT_HTTP_OTAF_SUPPORT | EXT_TCP_IP_SSL_16K_RECORD)
```
 
### 4.3 To Load Certificate 

**rsi_wlan_set_certificate()** API expects the certificate in the form of linear array. Convert the pem certificate into linear array form using python script provided in the SDK `<SDK>/resources/certificates/certificate_script.py`.

   For example : If the certificate is ca-certificate.pem, enter the command in the following way:
   python certificate_script.py ca-certificate.pem 
   The script will generate ca-certificate.pem in which one linear array named ca-certificate contains the certificate.

Root CA certificate needs to be converted as mentioned above.

After the conversion, place the converted file in `<SDK>/resources/certificates/` path and include the certificate file in rsi_http_otaf_app.c

  
For firmware download using HTTPs Apache server, replace the below certificate include in application

```c 
 // Certificate includes
 #include "cacert.pem"
 Replace the certificate in `rsi_wlan_set_certificate()` API in the application with the converted pem array.
 
 // Load Security Certificates
 status = rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE, cacert, (sizeof(cacert) - 1));
```

**Note:** For AWS S3 use the certificate "aws_starfield_ca.pem.h" and for Azure Blob storage use the certificate "http_baltimore_ca.pem.h" included in release pacakge for SSL connection. The corresponding rsi_wlan_set_certificate function calls would be as follows:

For AWS

```c
status = rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE, aws_starfield_ca, (sizeof(aws_starfield_ca) - 1));
```

For Azure

```c
status = rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE, http_baltimore_ca, (sizeof(http_baltimore_ca) - 1));
```

![Windows Network Access page](resources/readme/image412.png)

* Start Apache Service in Windows
    * Open RUN in windows using WIN+R button.
    * Input "services.msc" into RUN
    * This will open your Windows System Services
    * In the list of services running you can find Apache2.x present.
    * Start the service as shown below

![Start the service](resources/readme/image413.png)

* Now that your Apache has started and running, check it by using your browser. Open a Web browser and type the machine IP in the address bar and hit Enter. You should see the below, if server has started successfully.

![If server has started successfully.](resources/readme/image414.png)

* As you can see the connection is "Not Secure" means it is running HTTP server.
* Configure HTTP Wamp-Apache Server to Download firmware
    * Goto the Wamp Root directory, in my case it is C:\wamp64 and navigate to "www" folder C:\wamp64\www.
    * Create a new folder in that directory, in my case I created a folder named "Firmware". [Folder Structure: C:\wamp64\www\Firmware]
    * In the "Firmware" folder create an "index.html" file and write below contents to the file.
    
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body>
            <h2>Using a Relative File Path</h2>
            <a href="firmware.rps" download>Download_Version_6</a><br><br>
            <a href="firmware1.rps" download>Download_Version_4</a>
        </body>
    </html>
```
    
* This code will link your resources to Apache server, so that those files can be downloaded.
* you can edit href values in the index.html to your firmware file names.
* Make sure to copy all the firmware files into the present directory, C:\wamp64\www\Firmware. Save the file and Exit.
   
    ```html
    <a href="<your-firmware-file>-1.rps" download>Download_Version_6</a><br><br>
    <a href="<your-firmware-file>-2.rps" download>Download_Version_4</a>
    ```
* Configure HTTPD.conf file for Wamp-Apache Server
    * Open httpd.conf file in C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf\httpd.conf
    * Search or Find "DocumentRoot" and change it to below configuration. Save the file and Exit
   
   ```sh
    "${INSTALL_DIR}/www/Firmware"
    ```
* Restart Apache Service
    * Open Windows services, "WIN+R" → "services.msc" → ENTER
    * Check for Apache service and Restart the service
    * In the above configuration, we have created a resource for our server in "Firmware" folder.
    * Our access resource URL looks as shown below
    

>    `http://<your-ip-address>/<Sub-Resource-Directory>/<Resources>`
>
>    Eg: http://192.168.1.4/Firmware/firmware.rps
>        http://192.168.1.4/Firmware/firmware1.rps
    
* Giving the `http://<your-ip-address>/<Sub-Resource-Directory>` in browser should load as shown below. Clicking on any link should download the Firmware files.

![Webpage in browser](resources/readme/image415.png)

* Get the resource Information and test with Application
  * In the RS9116 FOTA application, make below changes and test application this should start downloading firmware.
  
  ```c
  #define HTTP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS "192.168.1.4"              //Replace this values related to your requirements
  #define HTTP_URL               "Firmware/RS9116C.2.2.0.0006.rps"          //HTTP GET request resource name
  #define HTTP_HOSTNAME          "192.168.1.4"//Replace this values related to your requirements
  ```
> **Warning:** Make sure that you are able to Access the WAMP-Apache Server (with its IP Address) is accessible to other systems in the same network, if not follow the Changing PHP Configurations. Else proceed with next steps

* Changing PHP Configuration 
  * The below steps to be done only when you face an issue of not able to access the WAMP-Server from other machines in the network. Issue shown below :

![Issue of not able to access the WAMP-Server from other machines](resources/readme/image416.png)

  * Give permissions to the newly created resource `"<Sub-Resource-Directory>"`
  * Open "phpmyadmin.conf" file in "C:\wamp64\alias\phpmyadmin.conf"
  * Add the line shown below into the end of file "phpmyadmin.conf" file. Save and exit the file.

    ```sh
    <Directory "c:/wamp64/www/<Sub-Resource-Directory>/">


    For example,
    <Directory "c:/wamp64/www/Firmware/">
    Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
    AllowOverride all
    Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ```
  * Restart Apache service and now the resource should be accessible from any systems connected in the same network.

> **Note:**
> Even though if you are not able to access `http://<your-ip-address>/` this page directly, you will be able to access your resources from here `http://<your-ip-address>/<Sub-Resource-Directory>/` as we gave only permissions for this


### 6.4 Configuring and Uploading Firmware on Apache HTTPs:
HTTPs Sever configuration for Apache requires Wamp server, if you have not installed it, follow the **"Step 1: Download and Install Wamp-Apache Server"** step and continue with the HTTPS steps in this document.
* **Download and Install OPENSSL for windows**
    * OpenSSL for windows from here (https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
    * Do default install for OpenSSL.
    * We can only run OpenSSL using command prompt, for that we need to first find the openssl.exe file.
    * Normally it will be in "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe"

* **Generate required certs**
   > **Note:** If you already have the reqired certs to run the server then, skip the **Generate required certs** step, copy your certs to `C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf` directory and update the `httpd-ssl.conf` file with these certificate paths shown in **HTTPD Configuration** step. 

   * Open Command Prompt in Administrator privilege's.
   * Change directory to your openssl.exe file "cd C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\"
   * Execute the below command to generate a private.key file with AES 256 encryption. 

 ```sh
    openssl.exe genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 2048
    openssl.exe rsa -in private.key -out private.key
    openssl.exe req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 36500 -config <your-wamp-apache-openssl.conf-file-path>
    openssl.exe req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 36500 -config C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf\openssl.conf
 ```
    
   * Now there will be two files created [Private.key and certificate.crt] in "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\" directory, copy them to "C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf"

* **HTTPD Configuration**
  * Open "httpd.conf" file in "C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf"
  * Uncomment the below shown lines in that file. Save and Exit.
  ```sh
  LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
  Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
  LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so
  ```
  * Open "php.ini" file in "C:\wamp64\bin\php\php5.6.40" and uncomment the below line in the file
  
      `extension=php_openssl.dll`
  * Open "httpd-ssl.conf" file in "C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.46\conf\extra" and update the below paths with proper information (i.e provide system relative paths)
  ``` sh
  <VirtualHost default:443>
  General setup for the virtual host
  DocumentRoot "C:/wamp64/www"
  ServerName 192.168.43.85:443
  ServerAdmin admin@example.com
  ErrorLog "C:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.46/logs/error.log"
  TransferLog "C:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.46/logs/access.log"

  SSLCertificateFile "C:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.46/conf/certificate.crt"
  SSLCertificateKeyFile "C:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.46/conf/private.key" 
  ```
  * Run below command to check if the configurations given above are proper or not. If the configurations are proper, it will return "Syntax OK"

      `httpd.exe -t`
* **Configure HTTPS Wamp-Apache Server to Download firmware**
  * Goto the Wamp Root directory "C:\wamp64" and navigate to "www"
  * Create a new folder in that directory "Firmware". [Folder Structure: C:\wamp64\www\Firmware]
  * In the "Firmware" folder create an "index.html" file and write below contents to the file.
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <body>
            <h2>Using a Relative File Path</h2>
            <a href="firmware.rps" download>Download_Version_6</a><br><br>
            <a href="firmware1.rps" download>Download_Version_4</a>
        </body>
    </html>
```
  * This code will link your resources to Apache server, so that those files can be downloaded.

  * Make sure to copy all the firmware files into the present directory, C:\wamp64\www\Firmware

  * you can edit href values in the index.html to your firmware file names.
```html
    <a href="<your-firmware-file>-1.rps" download>Download_Version_6</a><br><br>
    <a href="<your-firmware-file>-2.rps" download>Download_Version_4</a>
```
  * Save the file and Exit.
* **Restart Server**
  * Open RUN, "WIN+R" → "services.msc" → ENTER
  * Restart the Apache service.
  * Open browser and give your Apache server URL

![Give your Apache server URL](resources/readme/image418.png)

> * Here click on "Advanced Settings" and click on "Proceed to 192.168.43.85 (unsafe)"
> * You will be able to access the page and resources in HTTPS.

![Access the page and resources in HTTPS](resources/readme/image419.png)


> **Note:** Make sure to check your HTTPS server from other local machines present in the same network. It should be accessible.
