DHCP_MODE refers whether IP address configured through DHCP or STATIC

```c
#define DHCP_MODE                              1
```

> Note:
> To configure, STA IP address through DHCP then set DHCP_MODE to "1" and skip configuring the following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.

Refer [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`


### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform 

#### 5.2.1 Using STM32 

Refer [Getting started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/) 

- Configure STM32 CN10 header pin-30(PB13) should connect to UULP_GPIO_0 and STM32 pin-2 should connect to UULP_GPIO_0.
- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/tcp_logging_stats/projects/tcp_logging_stats-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` 
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**


#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32 

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Configure EFX32 pin-9(PD03/PB01 GPIO) should connect to UULP_GPIO_0 and EVFX32 pin-7(PD02/PB00 GPIO) should connect to UULP_GPIO_2.
- Open Simplicity Studio and import the project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/tcp_logging_stats/projects`
- Select the appropriate .slsproj as per the Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3**
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**


### 5.3 Common Steps 

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect RS9116W EVK in STA mode.
2. Open iperf application in Windows PC2(Remote PC) which is connected to the access point
3. Open TCP server using the below command in command prompt.

  `iperf.exe –s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1 -t <Time_interval>`

![Open TCP server in command prompt](resources/readme/image206.png)

4. After program gets executed, RS9116W EVK would scan and connect to Access point and get IP.

5. After successful connection, device STA connects to TCP server socket opened on Windows PC2 using TCP client socket and TCP socket will connect and disconnect continuously.

6. After successful connection, user can check below powersave statistics of Wakeup and Sleep times in communication port.

    - W indicates Wakeup time

    - S indicates sleep time
