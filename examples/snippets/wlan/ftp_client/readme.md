# FTP CLIENT

## 1. Purpose / Scope 

This application demonstrates how to connect to a FTP server opened on remote peer using FTP client, read a file from FTP server and write the file on to the FTP server.
In this application, the Silicon Labs device connects to Access Point and establishes FTP client connection with FTP server opened on remote peer. After successful connection, the application writes the data to a file created on the FTP server. Then demonstrates renaming of the file and then reads the contents of the renamed file.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a protocol through which internet users can upload files from their computers to a website or download files from a website to their PCs.
FTP is a client-server protocol that relies on two TCP communications channels between client and server and a command channel for controlling the conversation (command port) and a data channel for transmitting file content(data port). 

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

---
**Note!**
    If user wants to configure STA IP address through DHCP then set DHCP_MODE to 1 and skip configuring the following DEVICE_IP,GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.
    (Or)
   If user wants to configure STA IP address through STATIC then set DHCP_MODE macro to "0" and configure following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.
   IP address to be configured to the device in STA mode, it should be in long format and in little endian byte order.
   Example: To configure "192.168.10.10" as IP address, update the macro DEVICE_IP as 0x0A0AA8C0.

```c
#define DEVICE_IP                           0X0A0AA8C0
```

   IP address of the gateway should also be in long format and in little endian byte order
   Example: To configure "192.168.10.1" as Gateway, update the macro GATEWAY as 0x010AA8C0
	 
```c
#define GATEWAY                             0x010AA8C0
```

```c
#define NETMASK                             0x00FFFFFF
```

   The following parameters need to be configure if OS is used. WLAN task should be of low priority
	 
```c
#define RSI_WLAN_TASK_PRIORITY             1
```

   Driver task should be of highest priority
	 
```c
#define RSI_DRIVER_TASK_PRIORITY           2
```

   WLAN Task stack size is configured by this macro
	 
```c
#define RSI_WLAN_TASK_STACK_SIZE           500
```

   Driver Task stack size is configured by this macro
	 
```c
#define RSI_DRIVER_TASK_STACK_SIZE         500
```  
   
#### 4.1.2 User must update the below server configuration parameters

## 5. Testing the Application

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application. 

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with a PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

#### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [Getting started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/) 

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/ftp_client/projects/ftp_client-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx`
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Open Simplicity Studio and import the project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/ftp_client/projects`
- Select the appropriate .slsproj as per the Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3**
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


### 5.3 Common Steps 

  1. Configure the Access point in **OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK** mode to connect the Silicon Labs device in STA mode.
  2. Run FTP server on Windows PC2 and place "read.txt" file in the FTP directory.
  3. After the program gets executed, the Silicon Labs device will be connected to same access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get IP.
  4. After successful connection with the Access Point, the device connects to FTP server and reads the file content of given file ("read.txt") and creates a file name "write.txt" in FTP directory and writes the same content which is read from "read.txt" by replacing first few bytes with "FTP CLIENT DEMO". After successful file write WiSeConnect device disconnects from FTP server.
  5. Refer below images for message exchanges with FTP server and for read and write files,
