- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [Getting started with EFX32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Open Simplicity Studio and import theEFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/wlan/calibration_app/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. Make connections as per setup diagram (above) and set the appropriate settings on the Spectrum Analyzer by using the steps mentioned in below **Spectrum Analyzer Settings**.

2. After the program gets executed, the RS9116W device will start the transmit test with the given configuration.

3. Refer the below image which shows when RS9116W device transmits packets in Burst mode with different Tx power and different transmission rates in channel 1 with length 1000bytes.

   ```sh 
   RSI_TX_TEST_POWER    - 18dBm
   RSI_TX_TEST_RATE     - 1Mbps
   RSI_TX_TEST_LENGTH   - 1000
   RSI_TX_TEST_MODE     - BURST mode
   RSI_TX_TEST_CHANNEL  - 1 
   ```

4. Observe the Avg Freq Error (highlighted) on the screen and now try to adjust the frequency offset by using CLI commands with serial terminal (Docklight or Teraterm)
   
![Avg Freq Error (highlighted) on the screen](resources/readme/image_c7.png)


### Frequency Offset Correction

Frequency offset correction will be done by using the rsi_freq_offset command. This command is used during the RF calibration process and requires PER mode transmissions to be initiated prior. This command sends freq_offset (deviation) as observed on the signal analyzer against the expected channel frequency.

   
Prototype :  
> `rsi_freq_offset = freq_offset_in_khz <CR><LF>`  
> 
> Here freq_offset_in_khz means Frequency deviation in KHz or ppm
   
   
Examples :
> `rsi_freq_offset=10<CR><LF>`
>
> `rsi_freq_offset=-10<CR><LF>` 

![CLI commands](resources/readme/image_c8.png)

> **Note:** User can use the above command for any number of times till it gets tuned to desired frequency offset.

Open the serial terminal (Docklight/TeraTerm tool) and enter the following commands. User can provide input to correct frequency offset by sending the commands on console. This should lead towards a correction in the frequency offset as observed earlier and repeat till the error is within the tolerance limits (+/- 2 KHz tolerance limits).

See the below picture after frequency offset correction.

![After frequency offset correction](resources/readme/image_c9.png)

> **Note:** freq_offset_in_khz can be either +ve or -ve. When user enters the freq offset as observed on signal analyzer (+ve/-ve), a small freq offset correction is done. User needs to iterate this till the freq offset is within tolerance limits.


### Gain Offset Correction:

#### Update XO Ctune and Gain Offset

Using rsi_calib_write command the calibrated XO Ctune and calculated gain offset can be updated to target memory (Flash/Efuse).

   ```sh
   Prototype :
   rsi_calib_write=<target>,<flags>,<gain_offset>,<xo_ctune>
   ```

   | xo_ctune   | This field allows user to directly update xo_ctune value to calibration data bypassing the freq offset loop, valid only when BURN_FREQ_OFFSET & SW_XO_CTUNE_VALID of flags is set. |   | The range of xo_ctune is [0, 255], and the typical value is 80 |
   |

> **Note:** For RS9116 Rev 1.5, the user needs to calibrate gain-offset for low sub-band (channel-1), mid sub-band (channel-6), and high sub-band (channel-11) and input the three gain-offsets to this API and set the corresponding flags to validate it. However, for RS9116 Rev 1.4, the user needs to calibrate gain-offset for low sub-band (channel-1) only and input the three gain-offsets to this API with dummy values for mid and high gain offsets and set the flag for low gain offset only to validate it. \n

> **Precondition:** 
rsi_freq_offset command needs to be called before this command when xo ctune value from hardware register is to be used. 

Gain offset can be calculated using the following equation :

   gain_offset = observed_power_level + cable_loss - configured_power_level

Example :

   gain_offset = 14.3 + 1.7 (assuming) - 18 = -2 dBm

For 2 GHz band, the gain offset has to calibrated for three channels, viz. channel-1, channel-6, channel-11. After the three gain offsets are calculated these can be written to Flash using the `rsi_calib_write` command. the command to update gain offsets as -2, 2, 1 dBm for channel-1, channel-6, channel-11, and XO Ctune value as it reads from hardware is:

   `rsi_calib_write=1,114,-2,2,1<CR><LF>`

> NOTE : 
> The gain_offset can be negative but not a floating value.
> Once the frequency offset is corrected after multiple tries, rsi_calib_write commands has to be given once for all to write the values to flash.

The application reads the updated calibration values for verification by using `rsi_calib_read` command and displays.

### Spectrum Analyzer Settings
**Below are the necessary settings to see Polar Graph Spectrum Analyzer settings**
1. Frequency channel → center frequency→ 2412MHz for channel1.

2. SpanX scale → span→ 50MHz

3. Mode → WLAN → Mode setup → Radio Std → 802.11a/b/g → 802.11 b/g

4. Trigger → RF Burst

The frequency error section shows the error that needs to be adjusted. Using `rsi_freq_offset` and `rsi_calib_write` command user should be able to adjust the frequency error.
