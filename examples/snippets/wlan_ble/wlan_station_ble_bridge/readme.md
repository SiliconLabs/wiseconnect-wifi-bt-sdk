# WLAN Station BLE Bridge

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This example demonstrates how information can be exchanged seamlessly using coexwireless protocols (WLAN and BLE) running in the RS9116W EVK module.
In this coex application, The module connects with remote BTLE device (Smart Phone) and WiFi Access Point in station mode and do the data transfer on both interfaces.

The Application has WLAN and BLE tasks where as smart phone interacts with BLE task and remote PC interacts with WLAN task. When Smartphone connects and sends message to RS9116W EVK, BLE task accepts and sends to WLAN task, which in turn sends to remote PC which is connected to Access Point.
Similarly, when remote PC sends message to RS9116W EVK, the message will be sent to Smartphone via BLE task.Thus messages can be seamlessly transferred between PC and Smartphone.

## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `rsi_wlan_app.c` file 

**4.1.1** User must update the below parameters  

SSID refers to the name of the Access point.

```c
#define SSID                                         "SILABS_AP"
```

CHANNEL_NO refers to the channel in which device should scan. If it is 0, device will scan all channels. 

```c
#define CHANNEL_NO                                   0
```

SECURITY_TYPE refers to the type of security. In this application STA supports Open, WPA-PSK, WPA2-PSK securities.

   Valid configuration is: 

   - RSI_OPEN - For OPEN security mode
   - RSI_WPA  - For WPA security mode 
   - RSI_WPA2 - For WPA2 security mode

```c
#define SECURITY_TYPE                                RSI_WPA2
```

PSK refers to the secret key if the Access point configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.
 
```c
#define PSK                                          "1234567890"
```

DEVICE_PORT port refers SSL client port number

```c
#define DEVICE_PORT                                  5001
```

SERVER_PORT port refers remote SSL server port number

```c
#define SERVER_PORT                                  5001
```

SERVER_IP_ADDRESS refers remote peer IP address to connect with SSL server socket.

   IP address should be in long format and in little endian byte order.

   Example: To configure "192.168.10.100" as IP address, update the macro SERVER_IP_ADDRESS as 0x640AA8C0.

```c
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS                            0x640AA8C0
```

**4.1.2** The desired parameters are provided below. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements.

To Load certificate:

```c
#define LOAD_CERTIFICATE                             1
```
   If **LOAD_CERTIFICATE** set to 1, application will load certificate which is included using rsi_wlan_set_certificate API.

   By default, application loading "cacert.pem" certificate if **LOAD_CERTIFICATE** enable. In order to load different certificate, user has to follow the following steps:

rsi_wlan_set_certificate API expects the certificate in the form of linear array. So, convert the pem certificate into linear array form using python script provided in the SDK "certificate_to_array.py"

  Ex: If the certificate is wifi-user.pem. Give the command in the following way
  python certificate_to_array.py ca-cert.pem
  Script will generate wifiuser.pem in which one linear array named cacert contains the certificate.

After conversion of certificate, update `rsi_ssl_client.c` source file by including the certificate file and by providing the required parameters to rsi_wlan_set_certificate API.

> Note:
> Once certificate loads into the device, it will write into the device flash. So, user need not load certificate for every boot up unless certificate change.

So, define LOAD_CERTIFICATE as 0, if certificate is already present in the Device.

> Note:
> All the certificates are given in the path `<SDK>/certificates`

To configure IP address

   DHCP_MODE refers whether IP address configured through DHCP or STATIC

```c
#define DHCP_MODE                                    1
```
> Note:
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through DHCP then set DHCP_MODE to "1" and skip configuring the following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros.
> (Or)
> If user wants to configure STA IP address through STATIC then set DHCP_MODE macro to "0" and configure following DEVICE_IP, GATEWAY and NETMASK macros. 

IP address to be configured to the device in STA mode should be in long format and in little endian byte order.

3. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs BLE is in Advertising state and WLAN connects to Access Point and establishes SSL connectivity with SSL server opened on Windows PC1. Refer the given below image for connection establishment at windows PC1,

![OpenSSL server log Window](resources/readme/image255.png)

4. Open a BLE scanner App in the Smartphone and do the Scan.

5. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro **RSI_BLE_APP_SIMPLE_CHAT (Ex: "WLAN_BLE_SIMPLE_CHAT")** or sometimes observed as RS9116W EVK as internal name "**SimpleBLEPeripheral**".

6. Initiate BLE connection from the App.

7. After successful connection, LE scanner displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

8. Select the attribute service which is added **RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID**

  (Ex: 0xAABB) and enable Notification for attribute UUID **RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID** **(Ex: 0x1BB1)** to receive data sent by Wi-Fi STA.

![Enable Notification Mobile screenshot](resources/readme/image257.png)

9. Now from SSL server opened in Windows PC2 (Remote PC), send a message (Ex: "Hello from WiFi STA") to RS9116W EVK. RS9116W EVK forwards the received message from SSL server to remote BTLE device which is connected to Silicon Labs BTLE device over BTLE protocol. User can observe the message notification on attribute UUID **RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID** (Ex: 0x1BB1) in BTLE scanner app.

> Note: 
> rsi_wlan_app_send_to_btle() function is defined in rsi_ble_app.c to send message from WLAN task to BTLE task. 

10. Now send a message (Ex: "Hello from BT peripheral") from GATT client (from smart phone BLE scanner app) using attribute **RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID** 
    (Ex: 0x1AA1) to RS9116W EVK. RS9116W EVK forwards the received message from BTLE remote device to SSL server over WiFi protocol. User can observe the message on UDP socket application.
