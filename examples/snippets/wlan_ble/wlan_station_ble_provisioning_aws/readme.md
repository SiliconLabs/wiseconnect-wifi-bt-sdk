# WLAN Station BLE Provisioning with AWS cloud

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This example demonstrates how to configure/connects RS9116W EVK to get the WLAN connection functionality using BLE provisioning. In this application, the Module starts advertising and with BLE Provisioning the Access Point details are fetched

The RS9116W EVK module is configured  as a station, which associates to an access point and then communicates with an AWS server using MQTT. Data will be continuously published until the device is disconnected from the access point.  

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC with Host interface (UART / SPI).
- Silicon labs [RS9116 Wi-Fi Evaluation Kit](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/rs9116x-sb-evk-development-kit)

```

**4.4 To Load Certificate**

   **rsi\_wlan\_set\_certificate()** API expects the certificate in the form of linear array. Convert the pem certificate into linear array form using python script provided in the SDK `<SDK>/resources/certificates/certificate_script.py`.
   
> For example : If the certificate is ca-certificate.pem, enter the command in the following way:
> python certificate_script.py ca-certificate.pem 
> The script will generate ca-certificate.pem.h in which one linear array named ca-certificate contains the certificate.
Root CA certificate, Device private key and Device client certificate needs to be converted as mentioned above

After the conversion, place the converted files in `<SDK>/resources/certificates/` path and include the certificate files in rsi_wlan_app.c

   ```c
   Replace the default Device certificate and Private key certificate include in the application with the converted pem file name.

   // Certificate includes
   #include "aws_client_certificate.pem.crt.h"
   #include "aws_client_private_key.pem.key.h"

   Replace the default Device certificate and Private key certificate given in `rsi_wlan_set_certificate()` API in the application with the converted pem array.

   // Load Security Certificates
   status = rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CLIENT, aws_client_certificate, (sizeof(aws_client_certificate) - 1));
  
   status =
   rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY, aws_client_private_key, (sizeof(aws_client_private_key) - 1));
   ```

> NOTE :
> For AWS connectivity, StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
>
> The StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and it plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
>
> On RS9116 device, we do not maintain root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate for successful mutual authentication to AWS server.
>
> The certificate chain sent by AWS server is as below:
> id-at-commonName=Amazon,id-at-organizationalUnitName=Server CA 1B,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Amazon Root CA 1,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority ,id-at-organizationName=Starfield Technologies, Inc.,id-at-localityName=Scottsdale,id-at-  stateOrProvinceName=Arizona,id-at-countryName=US)
>
> On RS9116 to authenticate the AWS server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA is validation is successful , other certificates sent from the AWS server are validated.
> RS9116 don't authenticate to AWS server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate and would result in Handshake error.
> StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is at https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt

### 5.3 Execution of AWS IoT with BLE Provisioning

#### 5.3.1  BLE Provisioning with Windows Application

1. Configure the Access point with internet connection in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect the RS9116W EVK in STA mode.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

   **Note** Turn on **BT** in the PC.
  
3. Go to folder  `<SDK>/utilities/windows_ble_provisioning_app` and Run **Silabs_Connect.py** in the command prompt.
  
4. Executing the application in the command prompt as stated in the above point will open the GUI (with the â€œBLE SCAN ONâ€� button.

![Silicon labs connect GUI](resources/readme/image_aws15.png)
   
5. Check for the configured name in the BLE scanned list and connect to the â€˜SILABS_BLE_CONFIGURATORâ€™, by clicking on it.
   
![Silicon labs BLE Configurator ](resources/readme/image_aws16.png)
   
6. Once the BLE connection is successful, Wi-Fi access points scan list will be populated. Click on the Access Point (AP) SSID and enter the password of the AP, to which you would  like to connect. 
   
![ Silicon labs Wi-Fi access points](resources/readme/image_aws17.png)

   **Note** Now go to section **5.3.3** MQTT connection for AWS connection

### 5.3.2 BLE Provisioning with Android Application

1. Silicon Labs Connect app is available in the `<SDK>/utilities/` folder. Currently, this app will be available for Android devices only.
   
2. Once the application gets executed, launch the Android application which you have already installed on Android mobile. 

3. Click on BLE Provisioning.

![BLE Provisioning BLE connect app](resources/readme/image_aws18.png)

4. It will scan for the RS9116 module, and it appears in the list. For example, â€œSILABS_BLE_Configuratorâ€� on the UI, select this.
  
![Module appears in the list](resources/readme/image_aws19.png)
  
5. Now, RS9116 module will start as a station and scan for the access points (AP) nearby.
    
6. Once the list of AP scan results is displayed on the screen, you can select the SSID of the AP to which you want to connect. 

![Module SSID](resources/readme/image_aws20.png)
   
7. Click on the SSID of the AP, enter â€œpasswordâ€� if the AP is in security mode. Click on â€œConnectâ€� to associate with the access point.

8. Once Silicon labs RS9116 module is connected to the access point, you can notice on the GUI as below.

![Module Access](resources/readme/image_aws21.png)
   
9. This completes the BLE provisioning using Android application, next step is the MQTT communication.

### 5.3.3 MQTT Connection

1. Once MQTT connection completed , device subscribed to specific Topic and waits for data from the Cloud.
   if any data received through AWS cloud from subscribed clients, then module publishes temperature sensor reading to MQTT client in case of EFR32.
   While in case of  STM32 random temperature readings ranges from 25-40 is published to MQTT client through AWS cloud.

2. You can use any MQTT client and connect to the AWS cloud, for subscribe and publishing messages.
