### 3.4 Bare Metal/RTOS Support

This application supports bare metal and RTOS environment. By default, the application project files (Keil and Simplicity Studio) are provided with bare metal configuration. 


## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** `rsi_bt_power_save_profile.c` file and update/modify following macros.

   1. RSI_BT_LOCAL_NAME **-** Name of the Wyzbee (Master) device

   2. PIN_CODE - Four-byte string required for pairing process.

   3. PSP_TYPE – Power save profile type.

   **Note:** 1. PSP_TYPE is only valid RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2.
             2. RSI_MAXRSI_MAX_PSP is only valid in case of BT._PSP is only valid in case of BT.
   

   4. SNIFF_MAX_INTERVAL - Sniff Maximum interval value

   5. SNIFF_MIN_INTERVAL – Sniff Minimum interval value

   6. SNIFF_ATTEMPT - Sniff Attempt Value

   7. SNIFF_TIME_OUT – Sniff Timeout Value

   8. **To Enable Power Save**

   **PSP\_MODE** refers power save profile mode. The WiSeConnect device supports following power modes in BT

   **RSI\_ACTIVE (0):** In this mode, the module is active and power save is disabled.

   **RSI\_SLEEP\_MODE\_2 (1):** This mode is applicable when the module is connected state. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO handshake or Message exchange, therefore handshake is required before sending data to the module.

   **RSI\_SLEEP\_MODE\_8 (8):** In this power mode, the module goes to power save when it is in the unassociated state with the remote device. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO handshake or Message exchange, therefore handshake is required before sending the command to the module.

```c
#define PSP_MODE                                      RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2
```
   **Note:** For **RSI*****SLEEP\_MODE\_2*** *and* ***RSI\_SLEEP\_MODE\_8*** *modes****,*** *GPIO or Message based handshake can be selected using* ***RSI\_HAND\_SHAKE\_TYPE*** *macro which is defined in* ***rsi\_bt\_config.h***
   

   **Note:** In this example, user can verify RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2 with Message based handshake. If the user wants to verify other power modes, the user has to change the application as well as GPIO handshake signals
   

   **PSP\_TYPE** refers power save profile type. The WiSeConnect device supports following power save profile types in BT mode,

   RSI_MAX_PSP (0): In this mode, the WiSeConnect device will be in Maximum power save mode. i.e. Device wakes up for every DTIM beacon and does data Tx and Rx.

```c
#define PSP_TYPE                                      RSI_MAX_PSP
```
**4.2**  Open `rsi_bt_config.h` file and update/modify following macros,

```c
#define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                           FEAT_SECURITY_OPEN
#define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS                             RSI_DISABLE
#define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                    TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT
#define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                    FEAT_CUSTOM_FEAT_EXTENTION_VALID
#define RSI_EXT_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                (EXT_FEAT_LOW_POWER_MODE\|EXT_FEAT_XTAL_CLK_ENABLE\|RAM_LEVEL_NWP_ALL_MCU_ZERO)

```

   `RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE` is used to select GPIO or Message based handshake in `RS_SLEEP_MODE_2` and `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8` modes**.**

```c
#define RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE                           GPIO_BASED
```

## 5.3 Common Steps

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module initializes the SPP profile and waits for the incoming connection.

2. Open Bluetooth SPP manager app on mobile and do the scan until Silicon Labs module (Ex: "SPP_SLAVE") gets present in the scan list

3. After the successful scan, select the device and initiate pairing to Silicon Labs module.

4. After initiating pairing, Pairing request will pop-up at smartphone side and issue secret key which is given at Silicon Labs module (PIN_CODE) side.
