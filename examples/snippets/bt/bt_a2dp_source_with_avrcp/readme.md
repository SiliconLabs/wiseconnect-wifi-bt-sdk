# BT A2DP Source with AVRCP

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the RS9116W EVK with A2DP source profile with AVRCP. The module streams the audio data in SBC encoded format to the remote devices (like headesets) for playback the audio.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC with Host interface(UART/ SDIO).

### 3.4 RTOS Support

This application supports only RTOS environment. By default, the application project files **IAR IDE** are provided with OS configuration in the SDK. 


## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `rsi_a2dp_source_avrcp.c` file and update/modify following macros,

   `RSI_BT_LOCAL_NAME` refers name of the Silicon Labs module to appear during scanning by remote devices.
   
```c
#define RSI_BT_LOCAL_NAME                                              "A2DP_AVRCP_SOURCE" 
```
   
   `RSI_BT_REMOTE_BD_ADDR` refers BD address of the Remote device to which Silicon Labs device has to connect.
   
```c
#define RSI_BT_REMOTE_BD_ADDR                                          "D0:8A:55:51:26:EB"
```
   
   **PIN\_CODE** refers four bytes string required for pairing process.
   
```c
#define PIN_CODE                                                       "0000"
```
   
   Following are the non-configurable macros in the application. BT_GLOBAL_BUFF_LEN refers to the number of bytes required by the \n 
   application and the driver.
   
```c
#define BT_GLOBAL_BUFF_LEN                                             15000
```
   
**4.2** Open `rsi_bt_config.h` file and update/modify following macros
   
   `RSI_AUDIO_DATA_TYPE` refers input audio file format. Select MP3_AUDIO for .mp3 format, PCM_AUDIO for .wav format, SBC_AUDIO for .sbc formate
   
```c
#define PCM_AUDIO                                                      1
#define ARRAY                                                          2
#define RSI_AUDIO_DATA_SRC                                             BIN_FILE
```
    
   `RSI_AUDIO_DATA_SRC` refers audio source type. Select BIN_FILE, if we have audio files and ARRAY if file system is \n 
   not supported in host, we can pass buffered data.
   
```c
#define BIN_FILE                                                       1

## 5.Testing the Application

Follow the steps below for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with a PC](http://draft-docs.suds.silabs.net/rs9116-wiseconnect/2.4/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-pc/) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware file is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.1.1 Building the Application on the Host Platform

Refer getting started with IAR IDE, `<SDK>/examples/snippets/bt/bt_a2dp_source_with_avrcp/platforms/nxp/rt595RS9116W_with_NXP_RT595_User_Guide` 
- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/bt/bt_a2dp_source_with_avrcp/projects/iar/bt_a2dp_source.eww`
- Build the project in IAR IDE
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from NXP RT595 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected as mentioned above, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the application steps from **5.2**

### 5.2 Common Steps

   1. Keep Remote device in discover-able and connectable mode.
   
   2. Run the A2DP source AVRCP application
   
   3. Now Silicon Labs module is trying to connect with Remote device.
   
   4. After Successful connection, Silicon Labs device will connect with remote device in A2DP level and AVRCP level
   
   5. After Successful A2DP and AVRCP connections, Silicon Labs device will transfer the Audio data to remote device .
   
   6. Silicon Labs device will also acts as AVRCP target to support the pause and play options from the A2DP sink device(Remote device)
