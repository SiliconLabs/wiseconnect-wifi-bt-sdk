# BT SPP Dual Role with Secure Pairing

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure RS9116W EVK in Master/Slave mode and establish SPP profile connection with remote Master/Slave device using secure simple paring (SSP) and data exchange between two devices using SPP profile.

In this Application, the module configures in Master mode and waits to accept SPP profile level connection using secure simple pairing (SSP) from remote device. After successful SPP connection, Application will wait for data to receive from connected remote device. If remote device sends data to module, the module receives the data and send back the same data to remote device using SPP profile.

And also in this Application, the module configures in Slave mode and waits to accept SPP profile level connection using secure simple pairing (SSP) from remote device. After successful SPP connection, Application will wait for data to receive from connected remote device. If remote device sends data to module, the module receives the data and send back the same data to remote device using SPP profile.

### 5.3 Common Steps

**Executing the Application for Master Mode**

1. Power on Bluetooth in smart phone and put it in visible mode to all Bluetooth devices(Can be done through "Bluetooth SPP Manager" app. As shown in the below image.

![Bluetooth Power On - Visible Mode](resources/readme/image16a.png)
   
2. Tap the "Set Device Discoverable" option in the App. By again tapping the "Allow/Yes" in the pop-up, the module will be discoverable for 60Seconds.
   
![Tap the "Set Device Discoverable" option in the App](resources/readme/image17a.png)
   
3. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module initiates basic connection with the remote device (Smart phone). User has to provide **PIN\_CODE** at remote device for successful connectivity. Find below images for connection at remote device.

![Silicon Labs module initiates basic connection with the remote device](resources/readme/image17b.png)

4. After a successful physical level connection, in smartphone, "connection established" notification message will be displayed which means profile level connection is completed.
   
5. After successful SPP Connection in mobile side, go to BT_MESSENGER tab which is next to DEVICES tab. Write some data (Ex: "Silicon Labs") and call "Send Message" option in that app. we can see that the same message has been exchanged between two modules which is kind of loopback test.
   
![Write some data in BT_MESSENGER tab](resources/readme/image17c.png)
   
**Executing the Application for Slave Mode**
  
1. After the program gets executed, the Silicon Labs module initializes the SPP profile and waits for the incoming connection.
  
2. Open the Bluetooth setting present in the mobile. Now scan for available devices in the settings menu until the Silicon Labs module (Ex: "SPP_SLAVE") gets listed in that scan list.
  
![Scan for available devices in the settings menu](resources/readme/image18a.png)
  
3. After the successful scan, select the device and initiate pairing to Silicon Labs module.
  
4. After initiating pairing, the Pairing request will pop-up at the smartphone side and issue a secret key which is given at the Silicon Labs module (PIN_CODE ) side. Then the module successfully establishes the physical level connection.
  
![Pairing request will pop-up at the smartphone side](resources/readme/image18b.png)
  
5. Open the "SPP Manager app", Tap on the "search devices" option visible in the app you will get scan results as shown below
  
![Tap on the "search devices" option visible in the app](resources/readme/image18c.png)
  
6. After tapping on the SPP_SLAVE in that scan list, it will initiate profile level connection as it already paired through physical level process.

7. After successful SPP Connection in mobile side, go to BT_MESSENGER tab which is next to DEVICES tab. Write some data (Ex: "Silicon Labs") and call "Send Message" option in that app. we can see that the same message has been exchanged  between two modules which is kind of loopback test.
