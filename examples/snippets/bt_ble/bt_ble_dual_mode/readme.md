   4. Now initiate connection from the SPP App running in the Smartphone1.

   5. In the App, Silicon Labs BT would appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BT_LOCAL_NAME.

   6. After BT SPP connection is established, send a message from the App to Silicon Labs BT.

   7. Open a LE App in the Smartphone and do Scan.

   8. In the App, Silicon Labs BLE would appear with the name configured in the macro RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME.
