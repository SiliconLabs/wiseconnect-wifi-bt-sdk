# Gain Table Update Example

## Purpose / Scope
This application demonstrates how to modify gain table offset/max power details. The app can be used to overwrite the default region based gain table with a user-defined region-based gain table.

There are two types of gain tables for BT and BLE protocols
  - Gain table holding maximum transmit power values
  - Gain table with maximum power vs. offset values

Both gain tables must be configured in the correct order to successfully apply changes in the firmware.

The application supports bare metal and RTOS environment. By default, the application project files (Keil and Simplicity Studio) are provided with bare metal and RTOS configuration. 

## Application Configuration Parameters
The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

### `rsi_wlan_config.h` modifications

```c
  #define CONCURRENT_MODE                RSI_DISABLE
  #define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP            FEAT_SECURITY_OPEN
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS              RSI_DISABLE
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP     TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT
  #define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP     FEAT_CUSTOM_FEAT_EXTENTION_VALID
  #define RSI_EXT_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP RAM_LEVEL_NWP_ALL_MCU_ZERO 
```

### `rsi_update_gain_table.c` modifications

To set opermode, update `RSI_BT_BLE_MODE`.
By default `RSI_BT_BLE_MODE` is set to Dual Mode i.e. `9`
  - `12` - BLE only mode
  - `4` - BT only mode
  - `9` - Dual mode 

```c
#define RSI_BT_BLE_MODE 9
```

The API used to update the gain table is:
```c
int32_t rsi_bt_cmd_update_gain_table_offset_or_max_pwr(uint8_t node_id,
                                                       uint8_t payload_len,
                                                       uint8_t *payload,
                                                       uint8_t req_type)
```
---
**Note!**
* This command must be used immediately after opermode request
* Internally, the firmware maintains two tables
    * Gain table holding Max Tx power values for all regions
    * Gain table with Max power vs offset values for each channel of all regions
* There are 5 regions supported and are FCC, ETSI, TELEC, KCC, WORLDWIDE. These FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC gain table max power level and offset values should be loaded in end-to-end mode via BT/BLE User Gain table. This has to be called upon every boot-up since this information is not saved inside flash. SoC uses these tables in FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC to limit power and not to violate allowed limits.
* For Worldwide region firmware uses Worldwide values for Tx. For other regions(FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC), Firmware uses min value out of Worldwide & Region based values for Tx.  Also there will be part to part variation across chips and offsets are estimated during manufacturing flow which will be applied as correction factor during normal mode of operation.
* This frame has to be used by customers who has done FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC certification with their own antenna.  All other customers should not use this. Inappropriate use of this frame may result in violation of FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC or any certifications and Silicon labs is not liable for that.**

**req_type** can be set to one of the following macros :
```c
#define UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_MAX_POWER 0  // For updating Gain table Max power
#define UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_OFFSET    1  // For updating Gain table offset
```
**node_id** can be set to one of the following macros :
```c
#define BLE_NODE 0  // For selecting BLE node
#define BT_NODE  1  // For selecting BT node
```

The following arrays will be used to update_gain_table based on `node_id` and `req_type`.

| `node_id`  | `req_type`                    | Payload Array                                    |
