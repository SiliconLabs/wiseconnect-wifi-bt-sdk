# HID on GATT

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure RS9116W EVK as GATT server in BLE peripheral mode and as GATT client in BLE central mode, and provides details of how to do read, notify and indicate operations with GATT server from connected remote device using GATT client and details of getting GATT information from remote GATT server in case of our module as client. 

HID (Human Interface Device) Service GATT server configures with HID service with notification characteristic UUID. When connected remote device writes data to writable characteristic UUID, module receives the data which is received on writable characteristic UUID and writes the same data to readable characteristic UUID and sends notifications to the connected device (or) remote device can read the same data using read characteristic UUID if notification enabled on client side.

HID Service GATT client will get HID service (primary service) , Report Map (characteristic service), and descriptors(client characteristic configuration and report reference) information from the remote GATT server. If remote device supports notify, our module will enable notify property and will be notified by the remote GATT server when value changed.

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/hid_on_gatt/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU

	- If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
	- If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

#### 5.3 Common Steps

**Server role**

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in Advertising state.

2. Open a default Bluetooth App and do the scan.

3. In the App, Silicon Labs module will appear with the name configured in the macro **RSI\_BLE\_APP\_HIDS (Ex: "HIDS")** or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "**SimpleBLEPeripheral**".

4. Initiate connection from the bt App and complete the paining process.

5. After successful connection, open note pad or any text editor in phone, you can see some text printing.

6. By default, application is sending some text (i.e. "hog ") in regular interval, which will come as a notification to smart phone.

7. While connection, smart phone will do service discovery and it will find the HID service with UUID **RSI\_BLE\_HID\_SERVICE\_UUID.** After that it will read report map and enables the notification.

8. Following are the screen shots of smart phone to test HID over GATT application.

**Client role**

1. Advertise a LE device which supports Human Interface Device Service.

2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will connect to that remote device based on given BD address.

3. After successful connection Silicon Labs module will read the services from the remote GATT server.

4. If remote device support notify property Silicon Labs module will enable notify, and ready to receive notifications from remote device.

5. Whenever GATT server changes value and notifies that Silicon Labs module will receive that value.
