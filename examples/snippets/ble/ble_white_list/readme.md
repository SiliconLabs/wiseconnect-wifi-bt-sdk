# BLE Whitelist

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application is used to add a particular BD-Address to the White List. The device to connect is saved on the white list located in the LL block of the controller.

This enumerates the remote devices that are allowed to communicate with the local device. The White List can restrict which device are allowed to connect to other device.

If it is not, it wont connect. Once the address was saved, the connection with that device is going to be an auto connection establishment procedure. 

This means that the Controller autonomously establishes a connection with the device address that matches the address stored in the While List.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

## 5. Testing the Application

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/)

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_white_list/projects/ble_white_list-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
	- If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
	- If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_white_list/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
	- If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
	- If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. Configure the remote ble device in peripheral mode and put it in advertising mode.

2. After the program gets executed, it adds the configured remote device addresses to the whitelist, and Silicon Labs device tries to connect only with the whitelisted remote device specified in **RSI\_BLE\_DEV\_ADDR or RSI\_REMOTE\_DEVICE\_NAME** macro and ble_whitelist_addr1 array

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.

4. After successful program execution the print in teraterm looks as shown below.
