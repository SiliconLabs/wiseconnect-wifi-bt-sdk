   - For Silicon Labs EFx32, use the latest version of [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
   
- Download and install the [iBeaconDetector](https://play.google.com/stor/apps/details?id=youten.redo.ble.ibeacondetector) app in the android smart phones for testing BLE applications. Users can also use their choice of BLE apps available in Android/iOS smart phones.

**iBeacon Advertise Data Format**

   iBeacon prefix   UUID        Major Number   Minor Number    TX Power
   9Bytes           16bytes     2Bytes         2 Bytes         1bytes

   Adv Flags        Adv Header  Company ID   iBeacon Type    iBeacon Length
   3 Bytes          2 Bytes     2 Bytes      1Byte           1Bytes

   **iBeacon Prefix:**
   Vendor specific fixed value.
   Default iBeacon prefix values setting by application is,
   Prefix = {0x02, 0x01, 0x02, 0x1A, 0xFF, 0x4C, 0x00, 0x02, 0x15}

   **UUID:**
   User generated proximity UUID.
   Remote devices recognize which beacon they approach on the basis of UUID, major and minor numbers.
   Default UUID, Major and Minor values setting by application is,
   UUID = {0xFB , 0x0B , 0x57 , 0xA2 , 0x82 , 0x28 , 0x44 , 0xCD , 0x91 ,
   0x3A , 0x94 , 0xA1 , 0x22 , 0xBA , 0x12 , 0x06}
   major_num = {0x11, 0x22}
   minor_num = {0x33, 0x44}

   **TX Power** is used to calculate distance from iBeacon.
   Default TX power value setting by application is,
   TX Power = 0x33

   Note:
   If the user wants to change the prefix, UUID, Major number, Minor number and TX Power values, change the following values in rsi_ble_ibeacon.c_ file.

   For Prefix:
   `<span style="color: #005032">uint8_t</span> adv[31] = {0x02, 0x01, 0x02, 0x1A, 0xFF, 0x4C, 0x00, 0x02, 0x15}; //prefix(9bytes)`

   **For UUID:**

   uint8_t uuid[16] = {0xFB , 0x0B , 0x57 , 0xA2 , 0x82 , 0x28 , 0x44 , 0xCD , 0x91 , 0x3A , 0x94 , 0xA1 , 0x22 , 0xBA , 0x12 , 0x06};
   For Major Number:
   uint8_t major_num[2] = {0x11, 0x22};
   For Major Number:
   uint8_t minor_num[2] = {0x33, 0x44};
   For TX Power:
   uint8_t tx_power = 0x33;

## 5. Testing the Application

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [STM32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/)  

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippetsble/ble/ble_ibeacon/projects/ibeacon-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
  - If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

- Import the EFR32/EFM32 project from `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_ibeacon/projects`
    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
  - If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
  - If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

### 5.3 Common Steps

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module would be in Advertising state.

2. Open iBeaconDetector app in the Smartphone and do Scan.

3. In the App, Silicon Labs module device would appear with the name configured in the macro **RSI\_BLE\_LOCAL\_NAME** (Ex: "ibeacon") or sometimes observed as "SimpleBLEPeripheral".

4. After successful scan, user can see the Silicon Labs device advertised data i.e UUID, Maximum Number, Minimum Number and TX Power in iBeaconDetector application.
