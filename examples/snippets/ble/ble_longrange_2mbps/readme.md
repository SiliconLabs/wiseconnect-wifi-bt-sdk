# BLE Longrange 2Mbps

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure/connects RS9116W EVK as a Central and can be used to update the PHY rates. The PHY update Procedure is used to change the Transmit or receive PHYs, or both.

The procedure can be initiated either on a request by the host or autonomously by the Link Layer. Either the central or the peripheral may initiate this procedure at any time after entering the Connection State.

User has to follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

### 5.1 Loading the RS9116W Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into RS9116W EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

#### 5.2.1 Using STM32

Refer [STM32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/)  

- Open the project `<SDK>/examples/snippets/ble/ble_longrange_2mbps/projects/ble_longrange_2mbps-nucleo-f411re.uvprojx` in Keil IDE.
- Build and Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
	- If RESET pin is connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
	- If RESET pin is not connected from STM32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run.
- Free run the project
- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**


#### 5.2.2 Using EFX32

Refer [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/), for settin-up EFR & EFM host platforms

    - Select the appropriate .slsproj as per Radio Board type mentioned in **Section 3.3** for EFR32 board.
   (or)
    - Select the *.brd2204a-gg11.slsproj  for EFM32GG11 board.
- Compile and flash the project in to Host MCU
- Debug the project
- Check for the RESET pin:
	- If RESET pin is connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need not press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run
	- If RESET pin is not connected from EFX32 to RS9116W EVK, then user need to press the RESET button on RS9116W EVK before free run

- Then continue the common steps from **Section 5.3**

## 5.3 Common Steps

1. Configure the remote BLE device in advertising mode.For remote mobile if connecting using name ensure that the device is named same as the value mentioned in RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME macro also see to it that Complete local name record is added to advertising data and Scan response data and connectable is ticked in options.

2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device tries to connect with the remote device specified in **RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR** **or RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME** macro.

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.

4. After connection, Silicon Labs device will read PHY rate of the remote device and set PHY rate of the remote device.

5. Observe PHY update complete event after setting PHY rate.
  
6. After successful program execution, the prints in teraterm looks as shown below.
